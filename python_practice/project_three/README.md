### Linear Regression on Experimental Data

**Objective**: Introduction to machine learning using Scikit-learn.

**Description**: Use a dataset (e.g., chemical concentration vs reaction rate) to predict one variable from another using linear regression. Split the dataset into training and testing sets, train a model, and evaluate it.

**Tools**: `Scikit-learn`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`

**Key Concepts**:
- Train-test split of data.
- Linear regression model (`LinearRegression` in Scikit-learn).
- Model evaluation: Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared score.

**Bonus**: Plot the regression line on the scatter plot of the data.
