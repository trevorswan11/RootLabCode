### Predictive Model for Polymer Properties

Objective: Apply machine learning to predict material properties.

**Description**: Use a dataset of polymer compositions and properties (e.g., tensile strength, elasticity) to train a predictive model for one of the properties. Experiment with different algorithms like Decision Trees and Random Forests.

**Tools**: `Scikit-learn`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`

**Key Concepts**:
- Decision Trees and Random Forest models.
- Cross-validation for model evaluation.
- Feature importance analysis.

**Bonus**: Try hyperparameter tuning using `GridSearchCV`.
