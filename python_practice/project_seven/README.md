### Image Classification Using Neural Networks
---

**Description**: Build a basic image classification model (e.g., classify images of different materials or objects) using a neural network.

**Tools**: `Keras` (from `TensorFlow`), `NumPy`, `Pandas`

**Key Concepts**:
- Building a simple neural network using Keras.
- Image data preprocessing.
- Training and evaluating the model.

**Bonus**: Improve performance by adding more layers or using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
