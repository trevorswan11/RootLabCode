### Time Series Analysis

**Description**: Use time-series data (e.g., temperature readings over days) and perform basic operations like calculating rolling averages and plotting trends.

**Tools**: `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`

**Key Concepts**:
- Date and time parsing in Pandas.
- Rolling averages and cumulative sums.
- Plotting trends and seasonal patterns.

**Bonus**: Decompose the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components using `statsmodels`.
